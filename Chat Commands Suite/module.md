Need some easily creatable or pre-made chat commands? Use my module to easily create and use 3 different pre-made chat commands.

READ Use.Md to see how to create commands

The code isnt my finest work. but, its gets the job done, of course this is open source. LuaU -- Version: 0.1 (outdated check releases)

Version Notes: 0.1: Project Start

1.0: Fully functional

1.1: Removed the auto_ function (previously added creator UserIds to the allowed table when it was Nil) - Buggy, - Difficult and not working properly May be added back later

1.2: New methods and table.
