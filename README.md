A conglomerate of all my projects that I created in Roblox.

Over the years I created multiple systems and projects inside of Roblox Studio. Many of those projects are here on github, many are also unfinished. One of my favorite creations was lithium, which is now over a year and half old which is so crazy to me becuase I remember making it. 
Roblox was really fun to create with but its time for me to move on even if thats hard.
